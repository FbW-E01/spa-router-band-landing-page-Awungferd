            Heavyweights CALIBAN aren’t interested in genres or being pigeonholed at this point. They’ve moved on. But as an integral part of the early modern metal scene in Europe—full-lengths Vent (2001), Shadow Hearts (2003), and The Opposite from Within (2004) cemented the Germans as must-hear, must-see talent—the tag was vouchsafed by fan and press alike upon CALIBAN’s crushing, breakdown-driven music. Now, more than a decade later, the attributes of modern metal persist within the Essen-based quintet’s music, but CALIBAN’s signature sound is informed by a more diverse set of influences. New album, Elements, is proof that the Germans are growing beyond the borders of the genre.</p>

            “Elements is a logical progression from the last album [Gravity],” says CALIBAN guitarist Marc Görtz. “But we definitely expanded the range of music [we wanted to incorporate] on Elements. It’s going in extremely different directions. It’s heavier, but also more melodic. Also, Andy [Dörner] is doing all the vocals—harsh and clean—on the new album.”

            Written over early summer through the fall of 2017, the main components of Elements took more time to complete due Görtz and CALIBAN’s exacting standards. The guitarist/songwriter says he didn’t really listen to other music while writing Elements. As a result, there are no defining or obvious influences coming into Elements that weren’t, say, on Gravity. It’s just CALIBAN, broader in scope, heavier in tone, and more melodic overall.
            “I started in early summer, writing the first couple riffs,” Görtz remembers. “But that’s not really considered a songwriting session. I constantly collect ideas. Then, I put them together, one after another, until they form a full song. I really try to not listen to too much music while I’m writing a new album. So, I guess there’s not one or two bands that I could mention as influences on Elements.”

            As with previous releases, CALIBAN invited a host of guests to appear on Elements. Long-time friends Matthi from Nasty and Sebastian “Sushi” Biesler from Eskimo Cowboy added vocals to “Ich blute für Dich,” as did Thy Art Is Murder’s Chris “CJ” McMahon, whose growls can be heard on “Before Later Becomes Never.” But the biggest surprise was the addition of Brian “Head” Welch, who added his unique voice to the pounding yet epic “Masquerade.”
